## Our Story

Right now it’s very sad to know that alñmost 25% of the students have had to desert their studies because of the financial crisis caused by the pandemic, many students have tried asking for financial support with bank credits, parents financial cushion, or savings.

Many people have wanted to come to the crowdfunding aid but normally this kind of projects are only about a new entrepreneurship, new start up or social help, they aren’t about helping others to pay their personal expenses.

Also the main problem that people have when they post a crowdfunding project is that they themselves have to create their own marketing in  different social media platforms different from the crowdfunding platform. Another problem is that when somebody donates, they don’t know if the money was really used for what it was promised, and they don’t even know what the advances of the program are. For example, once I decided to donate to a very interesting initiative, okay, everything went fine, I paid, but the only thing I received was the payment confirmation, it was very sad because I really wanted to know more about the project or the people managing the project. As the days went by, I expected to have the notification about what had happened with that project, it never happened, the only thing I was left with was that when reloading the project page, the page was as static as the first time except that more people had donated.This was disappointing, the most I got to know was that they reached their final goal without knowing if the project was carried out.

So we decided to create a social network platform to let people be uploading content about what they are using the money for in their projects, so donors are aware of it too and they become incentivized to donate more.

Our most difficult technical challenge was creating the backup because at the beginning we weren’t creating a backup, and in one moment everything broke up, nothing was working, so we had to search for a backup process even if our project was very small, when we created the backup feature, the backup was kept inside the whole code as if it were part of the project, and when it automatically saved, also saved the backup, so the second backup had the first backup, and the third back up had the second and first backup, an so on. It was a big problem because our project was very heavy and it was possible that at a future moment it were not possible to save more backups.  Then we searched how to omit saving the backup files in every backup, of course it was from an advanced version, fortunately we didn’t have a new problem concerning this accumulative backups.


I learned too many things in this project:
Wordpress is more robust than I thought, and its community so wide that it’s a new universe.

Knowing how to use Vi is very important because there are some files that can not be changed with emacs, only with Vi, also Vi is the default editor in every server and if I only need to use a  server once, downloading Emacs just for a single use is not justified.

I learned how to use Bitcoin Cash, and a multifirm Wallet, also this new universe of Cryptocoins.

When I start to learn a topic very well, I start to really enjoy it, so it was very satisfying to understand how this project works, supported by my peers. I also love to work in a team, have a brainstorming,  discuss new ideas, and know somebody else’s opinion. In this project we debated, argued, and laughed, it was a really enreaching team project.
